description: A set of open source components to power your billing and pricing experience
---


Welcome to Pricecn, a collection of beautiful, open source and free components to build your app's pricing and billing experience.

It's built on top of Shadcn, the world's most popular UI library, so you can get started easily and customize to your heart's content.

## Styles

The `pricing-table` component comes with 3 styles:

- `clean`: The simplest variant, and the easiest to customize.
- `classic`: Inspired by modern minimalism. For AI and SaaS products.
- `dev`: Sharp, retro vibes. For a neo-developer aesthetic.

## Installation

To install, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://pricecn.com/clean/pricing-table.json
```

This will download the pricing-table component in your components directory. You can swap `clean` for any of the styles above.
